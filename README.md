# Automatic Handwriting Quality Analysis: Classification Accuracy and Feature Interpretability

This repo contains all files used for my bachelor thesis at Technical University Berlin, Germany.

Supervised by [Prof. Dr. Bettina Berendt](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~bettina.berendt/) @ [IaS](https://www.tu.berlin/en/ias/about/team) TU Berlin.

## Usage

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt       # install repo requirements
```

### The Labeller

Used to acquire quality labels on handwritten document by human readers along two standardized scales [^1], [^2].

```bash
$ python labeller/labeller.py           # run from project root
```

### Generating Validation Dataset

To randomly sample a subset of the general dataset (used here for validation of the automatic labelling approach), run:

```bash
$ python data/build_validation_set.py   # run from project root
```
